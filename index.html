            <h1>"MONO" MONOLOGUE</h1>
            <h2>Teacher: You have reached the end of this introductory course to acting. The bulk of your grade rests upon the performance of today's monologues. Which brave soul amongst you would like to go first?</h2>
            <p>Teacher: Anyone? TIM! Excellent! Take a moment to prepare and then start when you are ready.</p>

            <p>Tim: [CLEARS THROAT] </p>
            <p>Infectious mononucleosis, sometimes colloquially known as the "kissing disease" from its oral transmission is a wide spread--</p>
            <p>Teacher: Hold please.</p>
            <p>Tim, are you reciting the Wikipedia article for mono?</p>
            <img src="StudioCdisappoint.png">
            <p>Tim: Yes.</p>
            <p>Teacher: Is that because when I told you "prepare a monologue", you thought I meant prepare a piece on mono?</p>
            <p>Tim: Yes.</p>
            <p>Teacher: Did anyone else prepare a monologue on mono?</p>
